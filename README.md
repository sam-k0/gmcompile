# gmcompile README


## Features

This extension allows you to compile your GMS1.4 games right away from VSCode!

**Make sure the GMS1.4 IDE is running in the background with your project loaded.**



## Requirements
**IMPORTANT**
If you cannot use this extension right away, you need to install the `ExternalCompiler.exe` from my **GitHub page** [here](https://github.com/sam-k0/quick-compile/releases/tag/1.0).


## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.compilerpath`: The location of "ExternalCompiler.exe"


**Enjoy!**
